                  <p>
                    When I first created this website, I was unsure of what my future held in the design world. I had been experimenting with graphic and print media design in high school and was unsure of where I would do my post-secondary education. Frankly, I had little desire to be a fine artist, but I wanted to pursue a discipline where I could combine my passion for creating engaging designs and my ever-present contemplation of how things work and why they work the way they do. Eventually I found a post-secondary degree program that I was quite happy with and here I am, on track to graduate from Wilfrid Laurier University with an Honors Bachelor of Design degree.
                  </p>
                </div>
                <div class="pb-20">
                  <p>
                    There came a time before even entering into that degree program though where I felt it was important to showcase my work online. Many university programs I was considering required portfolios to be considered for entry, and creating an online portfolio that could be used for multiple applications felt like a logical and efficient way to keep my options open. The purpose for the site as it current stands is different in some ways than the purpose for which it was originally built, but in many ways the core function remains the same.
                  </p>
                </div>
                <div class="pb-20">
                  <p>
                    Nowadays, a portfolio is a requirement for many job postings in this space. Specifically, recruiters often look to an applicant's portfolio to understand whether that designer can do the work, and do it well. Good portfolios document process in a way that showcases an applicant's talent, and good applicants are able to tell a captivating story with a limited amount of time and attention from a recruiter. It's an interesting requirement, but one that provides ample opportunity when carefully considered. The reason you're seeing this case study is because I like to think I've done just that with my portfolio website.

                  When I first built the site, I knew very little about what it took to get hired in the industry. I hadn't gone through the hiring process, and I hadn't hired any designers. The industry wasn't as evolved as it is now, and Medium wasn't crowded with posts detailing how to stand out like it is today. The original version of the site reflected my general lack of understanding of what my users really needed.

                <p>
                  The core of the mission of the site, as mentioned, is to communicate my value as a designer to the hiring manager. I knew I needed to take a closer look at that user group and try and better understand their true aims.<b> I re-designed and re-launched the site in December 2020 with improvements based on my new experiences and understanding of common hiring practices.</b>

                    Take the example below of the header text. This is the first thing the user sees when they visit the site. When I started out, I had little idea of what people wanted to see, and my statement reflected that. After listening to hiring managers talk about the importance of the first 10 seconds of visiting a site, I've revised the text many times to try and nail exactly what I want to communicate with that time.

Also, idk is short form for "I don't know" and originally this was meant to reflect my willingness to learn, but over time I've grown less comfortable having my first introduction to folks being the phrase "I don't know."</p>

By establishing a standard format, I'm able to quickly generate key talking points (often the sub-headings used throughout each section of the write-up) and expand as needed.</p>

                  My philosophy minor can get in the way when it comes to writing content. I'm passionate about ethics, rhetoric, and argumentation. Philosophical arguments are often written in less-than-simple English. Frankly, argumentation benefits when concepts are broken down into their most simple forms. The hope is that I am able to break things down simply on this page and on this site.

By leaning on established web design best practices and leveraging Bootstrap, I'm able to build a mobile-responsive site on an established grid without too much trouble. Having a framework for building pages that makes it easy and quick means I spend less time working on the architecture of the portfolio and more time refining the content.</p>

                  <p>
                    It might feel like it goes without saying, so I won't spend long on it: images help readers understand your content when done right. They are not a "silver bullet" or a replacement for well-written content, but they can definitely help users understand what you're trying to say. They also work to keep your users attention. From what I've heard in feedback sessions, users often skim pages looking for images that catch their eye and then read around that image for explanations.

                      I have come to take the approach of "show, don't tell" when it comes to site content. Because communicating process is so important, pictures are worth a ton. However, it can be equally ineffective to post a lot of photos without adequate explanations. I've tilted toward the content-heavy side of the spectrum throughout the history of the site, and am actively adding more and more images with each new revision. <b>I think hybrid images are especially effective: images that blend simple, easy to understand text content with visual interest such as colours or icons.</b>

The content folks are a key part of that: government services are complex, difficult to understand webs of interconnected patchwork. It's up to the very talented content design folks to make it all make sense, and help the teams that build services work toward making their services make sense (without the content folks holding their hands).</p>

I'm grateful for the opportunities to learn, grow, play and build things on this land, and by making the intentional acknowledgment, I hope to encourage others to consider how they can support Indigenous communities. The whole discipline of human-centered design is about having empathy for each other, and it would feel wrong not to be empathetic to the issues facing others.</p>

                      <p>Any time that I spend working on this portfolio is time I'm investing in my own growth. I have put hundreds of hours into this website, coding everything and learning along the way what goes into a good website. It's not perfect, but it is the sum of many years of work.</p>

                      <p>When considering what I would change about this site, there are a few things that come to mind. With more time and money available I would have loved to have done more formal usability testing with compensation for users. Obviously that is out of reach for now, but something I plan to do in the future. With even more time, I'd like to take a finer comb to the site in hopes of refining the content design and really tightening up the descriptions. Alas, the nature of the work is iterative and as I've cautioned myself over the years, done is better than perfect. Fail fast, fail often.</p>

                      <p>This site is the result of years of hard work. To every person I've made look this site over, I thank you for being gracious participants. I really see this site as a reflection of my growth as a designer and human, so thanks for sticking around for the ride. If you happen to be a hiring manager, who by some miracle is still reading this write up, thank you too. I really appreciate you giving me a chance.</p>

I attended Wilfrid Laurier University's Brantford campus in an area traditionally occupied by Anishinabeg, Haudenosaunee and Neutral peoples. I want to express my gratitude for the opportunity to learn and grow on this land, which has been cared for by the First Peoples of Canada. We must continue to care about the land and about the issues facing Indigenous peoples.</p>
