I attended Wilfrid Laurier University's Brantford campus in an area traditionally occupied by Anishinabeg, Haudenosaunee and Neutral peoples.

                    Many things have changed since COVID-19 began to impact our way of life, and the virus has undeniably accelerated the transition to a digital-first society. Specifically, the effects on the way governments engage with citizens cannot be overstated; many projects that may have otherwise taken years to be prioritized became the immediate focus of many public servants.

                    For Ontario's Ministry of Finance and the Canada Revenue Agency, collecting electronic signatures is something that has long been a topic of conversation but came into the spotlight specifically in a post-COVID world. Working with the Ontario Digital Service Lab as a product designer, I was tasked with an early-stage research project that would help solidify the understanding of user expectations for digitally signing documents.

                  <p>
                    I worked closely with stakeholders from the Ministry of Finance to develop prototypes of current-state and future-state implementations of eSignature collection, and independently facilitated user feedback sessions that helped to validate and question assumptions.

                  Working with a previously-hired vendor, we were initially unable to view any sort of demo of what a realistic potential solution could look like due to legal limitations in the early-stage of this project. Still, it was our mandate to provide thorough recommendations to the Ministry of Finance that would help inform a user-friendly eSignature implementation.

                  We observed that the process for signing and submitting an application to Healthy Smiles Ontario does not enable users to sign up entirely online. How might we enable the user to submit signatures online so that we are able to reduce the amount of time and effort it takes to enrol in HSO? Further, how can we design a simple, secure and inclusive experience that sees a reduction in the abandonment rate of users attempting to enrol?

              Typically, we’d hope to conduct sessions in-person to reach as large a scope of participants as possible. Obviously with everyone working from home, we were limited to online recruitment methods. It should be noted that everyone we spoke to was required to possess some level of technology literacy, as we conducted sessions virtually. Special attention was paid to outreach for low-income individuals, and we reached out to community health centres and other local community organizations for help reaching this user group.

                After clearly defining our problem space and objectives, I created a research plan for our feedback sessions that included a script and specific scenarios for users to walk through. Special attention was given to writing open-ended questions that avoided leading the user. If I were to directly ask the user what we were hoping to learn, it wouldn't make for great conversation or promote honest answers.

                As I worked to build the script independently, I was working in parallel on the prototype we would be showing to users. I worked with another designer on the prototyping, and took on a teaching role as they had no experience in Figma prior to this project. Together, we built a recreation of what the current process looked like, as well as a future-state for the application that adopted the Ontario Design System. We tested using the current-state visual standard, as it was decided that we would be best served showing users as close to current-state representations as possible.
                <br><br>
                As a team, we went over the script and prototype together to make sure it aligned with our research goals. I then facilitated user feedback sessions via Zoom, asking generative introductory questions and walking users through the prototype using Zoom's remote access features and our Figma document.

                  When creating scripts for user testing sessions, it’s important to understand that directly asking what we want to know doesn’t always make for a great conversation. We also want to avoid leading the user with our questioning, and allowing them to freely offer up an answer to the question we ask.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1 pb-20">
                <p>
                  Something that has been a challenge for me as I've learned and grown as a designer is becoming comfortable with the awkward silence. Usually the user offers up valuable feedback to get out of it, and so it's best to let a question sit until you're asked to clarify.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1 pb-20">
                <p>
                  As a simple example, we often ask “what are your thoughts on (a feature)” or “what would you expect from (a product or service)” rather than “do you like this?” ... Our hope is that this allows the user to offer up their own thoughts with less of a lead-in to their answer.

                  <p>I took an opportunity between rounds of testing to speak to some internal folks. The verification agents we spoke to had close-up knowledge around the types of users who typically applied for the Healthy Smiles Program, and their behaviors. Our project stakeholders gave us a great foundation, and after our feedback sessions we had a really solid set of questions for the folks who work up close and personal with these users most often.</p>

                    <li><i class="fa fa-circle-o"></i>Hope eSignature implementation will see a reduction in the rate of applications that are submitted incorrectly or without completed consent forms attached</li>
                    <li><i class="fa fa-circle-o"></i>Following-up with users to be able to edit their application, rather than requiring them to submit a new application all together, would be ideal future-state</li>
                    <li><i class="fa fa-circle-o"></i>Wondered if there was an opportunity to break up larger pages (such as input fields) into shorter pages to keep the users attention better</li>
                    <li><i class="fa fa-circle-o"></i>Because we are reaching so many types of users, we need to be incredibly careful with language (in it’s current form, it often confuses users)</li>

                  <p><b>I pride myself on being a feedback driven designer.</b> What that looks like in practice is taking findings from feedback sessions, analyzing their causes, and making improvements to the prototypes to better serve users. This is the core of the work that I do: I actively communicated with my stakeholders throughout this feedback analysis so that they were able to understand my interpretations of findings. Ultimately, qualitative research findings can be difficult to parse through, but removing the ego from the equation and remembering that good designers thrive on feedback makes for a much more effective team.</p>
                  <br>
                  <p>After carefully considering all user feedback, we identified core areas we could improve our prototype designs and make actionable recommendations. Although we were very early in the process, and the vendor had not yet been onboarded, these recommendations make up a good foundation for the project to move forward prioritizing user needs. Ultimately, the results from this work are mostly conceptual: these recommendations serve as best-practices, and exact interface designs will need to be tested further as they are developed.</p>

                    The project will continue to evolve over time; as we learn more from users, improvements will be made. Because the service is pre-launch, it is hard to quantify the amount of reach it will have. However, I can report that it recieved strong support internally, and the team of stakeholders I worked with is moving forward with the principles we recommended based on user feedback.

I attended Wilfrid Laurier University's Brantford campus in an area traditionally occupied by Anishinabeg, Haudenosaunee and Neutral peoples. I want to express my gratitude for the opportunity to learn and grow on this land, which continues to be cared for by the First Peoples of Canada. We must continue to care about the land and about the issues facing Indigenous peoples in Canada.<br><br>
